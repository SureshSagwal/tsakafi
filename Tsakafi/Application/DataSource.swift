What is the objective of this whole shindig?</strong><br><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><br>A:  We are a bunch of Tsa(  tea) and kafi ( coffee) enthusiasts who think it is time to demystify it. Tea has tannine, Coffee has caffeine. Both give you a nice kick start to your day or perk you up anytime of the day. There has been much praise and criticism on the good and bad effects of these beverages. The origins of both is not clear. It is like the invention of wheel. There are enough stories surrounding the myth of how tea or even coffee was first brewed. The basic difference is tea is dried and brewed as it is. Coffee bean is roasted, crushed and then brewed.<br>Every home has its own recipe of brewing this fantastic beverage. We want to create a platform to share these and debunk all the theories for there’s nothing like practice to (dis)prove a theory.<br></span><br><strong style=\"font-size: 25px;\">2.

Filter coffee will need medium ground, since fine ground will have the grains clog the fine holes of the filter. Coarse ground is perfect for an aeropress or Plunger, which needs a sieve and so on and so forth. Milk is an additive. Experienced drinkers have it neat.<br></span><br><strong style=\"font-size:25px;\">4. What is the best method of brewing tea? </strong><br>    <img src=\"http://tsakafi.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/7.png\" alt=\"cup\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-360\"><br><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><br>    A:  There is no perfect method. At the end of the day, or the beginning of it actually one should get heady with the aroma and when the liquid hits your palate, it should give one a sense of well being.<br>    Generally speaking, you take the leaves and infuse it in hot water. Add anything that suits your taste and have it. The most common form is boiling it with water, tea, sugar, ginger and such. It’s supposed to be fantastic mood enhancer when it’s had hot during winters and the cold variety in summers.<br>    </span><br>    <strong style=\"font-size:25px;\">5. What is the best method of brewing coffee?</strong><br>    <span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><br>A: None. Coffee, unlike tea needs some apparatus. Again, you rely on your nose to begin with. The roasted beans is ground based on the apparatus. Milk, sugar, cream, flavoured syrups are all additives based on your taste.<br>    Some of the methods are shown along with our products<br></span><br>    <strong style=\"font-size:25px;\">6. What else?</strong><br><span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><br>    A: Anything !The idea is to innovate with the basic ingredient. In winters, the warm variety can work wonders. It can be had sweet with sugar or honey. You can add a slice of lime for a great lemon tea. You can even crack some black pepper and salt and sip it.<br></span><br><strong style=\"font-size:25px;\">7. Children?</strong><br>    <span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><br>    A: Avoid! Let them grow up before their systems can handle these.<br>    </span><br>    <strong style=\"font-size:25px;\">8. What’s in it for me?</strong><br>    <span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><br>A: It’s setting free. All of this can be done at home, office, anywhere.<br>    </span><br>    <strong style=\"font-size:25px;\">9. What’s with this water at  70º&nbsp;C – 80º&nbsp;C  ?</strong><br>    <span style=\"font-size:18px;\"><br>    A:  Everyone knows water boils at 100 º&nbsp;C . It is generally believed that boiling water burns the coffee or singes the delicate lea leaves. As water heats up, the first bubble that comes up indicates 75-80 º&nbsp;C . Or boil the water and let it cool for 1-2 minutes. Same effect. Basically, don’t get bogged down. Just don’t hunt for a thermometer even if you love your coffee so much.</span></p></div></div>"
